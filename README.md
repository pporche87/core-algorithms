# Core Algorithms

Tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews. See the full list in the [algorithms.md](algorithms.md) file.

Base repository for the [Core Algorithms](http://jsdev.learnersguild.org/goals/123) goal.

## Usage and Examples

##### Factorial Function

This is the factorial function and unit test. The factorial function returns the factorial of a number. It returns 1 if handed a 0.

```
const factorial = (number) => {
  let answer = 1;
  if (number === 0) {
    return answer;
  }
  for (let i = number; i > 0; i -= 1) {
    answer *= i;
  }
  return answer;
};

export default factorial;
```

##### Factorial Function Unit Test   
```
import { expect } from 'chai';
import factorial from '../src/factorial';

describe('factorial()', () => {
  it('should be a function', () => {
    expect(factorial).to.be.a('function');
  });

  it('return the factorial of a number.', () => {
    expect(factorial(5)).to.equal(120);
  });

  it('returns 1 if handed 0', () => {
    expect(factorial(0)).to.equal(1);
  });
});
```
##### Merge Sort Function

This is the mergeSort function and unit test. It sorts and array of numbers using the mergeSort algorithm.
```
const merge = (left, right) => {
  const result = [];
  const leftLength = left.length;
  const rightLength = right.length;
  let leftIndex = 0;
  let rightIndex = 0;

  while (leftIndex < leftLength && rightIndex < rightLength) {
    if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
      result.push(left[leftIndex++]);
    } else {
      result.push(right[rightIndex++]);
    }
  } return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
};

const mergeSort = (sortedArray) => {
  const length = sortedArray.length;
  if (length < 2) {
    return sortedArray;
  }
  const middle = Math.floor(length / 2);
  const left = sortedArray.slice(0, middle);
  const right = sortedArray.slice(middle);
  return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
};

export default mergeSort;

```

##### Merge Sort Function Unit Test

```
import { expect } from 'chai';
import mergeSort from '../src/mergeSort';

describe('mergeSort()', () => {
  it('should be a function', () => {
    expect(mergeSort).to.be.a('function');
  });

  it('Sort an array of numbers using the merge sort algorithm.', () => {
    expect(mergeSort([10,
      2,
      7,
      5,
      8,
      3,
      6,
      1,
      4,
      9])).to.deep.equal([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
    expect(mergeSort([3,
      5,
      7,
      9,
      2,
      8,
      6,
      1,
      4,
      10])).to.deep.equal([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
  });
});
```

## Stretch

Pick a different programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Javaâ€¦) and write tests & implementations for each.

- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
- [ ] For each algorithm identified above, there exists:
  - [ ] a test file with multiple unit tests for each algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
  - [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
